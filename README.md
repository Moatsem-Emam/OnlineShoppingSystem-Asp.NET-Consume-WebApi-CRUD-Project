### Description

The Online Shopping System is a web application built with ASP.NET Core MVC. It enables users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products by consuming a RESTful ASP.NET Core Web API. This project showcases how to integrate and communicate with the backend API using HTTP Client to fetch and manipulate product data. Additionally, it includes features for implementing search, filtering, and basic pagination to enhance the user experience.

### Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core MVC:** The framework used for building the front-end web application.
- **C#:** The primary programming language for developing the application logic.
- **ASP.NET Core Web API:** The backend API that provides data services to the MVC frontend.
- **Entity Framework Core:** Used for database interaction and management.
- **LINQ:** Used for querying and manipulating data in the application.
- **SQL Server:** The relational database management system used to store and manage product data.
- **HTTP Client:** Utilized in the MVC application to consume the RESTful Web API for data retrieval and manipulation.

These technologies collectively power the Online Shopping System, allowing seamless interaction between the frontend and backend, efficient data management, and a responsive user experience.
